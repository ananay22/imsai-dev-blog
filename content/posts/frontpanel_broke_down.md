# Front panel repair
During the process of testing the [memory dumper card](/posts/memory_dumper), we found some how the 
front panel is behaving weirdly. 

Took quite a while for us to track down the problem, but eventually it narrowed down to a broken 74LS10
 (Dual Tri-input NAND gates). Which controls the input switches.
