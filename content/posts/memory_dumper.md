# Background
So we have got our first program running on the old IMSAI 8080 computer. Although the process of
flipping switches to program the machine in *binary* was an extraordinary experience for the first
few days, but very soon it got very tedious and slowing us down in the process of debugging the system.

With all the modern technology we have got, we decided to make some quick hardware that allows us
to directly write the memory without manually entering each byte.
